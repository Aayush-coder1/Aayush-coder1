## Hi there 👋

I am currently learning computer science and building projects to strengthen my fundamentals.

I’m a CS student based in India, focused on learning by doing.

I enjoy turning ideas into small projects, experiments, and code that helps me understand how things actually work.

Right now, I’m working on improving my problem-solving skills, exploring development, and building simple but meaningful projects.

My main tools include Git, GitHub, VS Code, and modern programming languages and frameworks as I continue learning.

I’m still early in my journey, but I’m consistent, curious, and always improving.

If you want to reach out, feel free to connect with me here on GitHub.

Fun Facts:
- I enjoy tech content  
- I like learning through hands-on practice  
- I believe consistency beats motivation  

Hobbies:
coding, exploring tech, learning new things
